# ShuffledSight

[ShuffledSight](https://alanlorenzetti.github.io/ShuffledSight/) is an intuitive, web-based deidentification tool designed to anonymize your file names,  ensuring an unbiased viewing experience. Simply select your files and let ShuffledSight rename them with random identifiers.   

Primarily designed for images but compatible with any file type, ShuffledSight randomly shuffles the order of your files, assigns new ordinal names while retaining the original extensions (e.g., file1.png, file2.png, fileN.png), and provides a tab-separated dictionary mapping the original names to the newly assigned ones. The renamed files and the dictionary are encapsulated within a ZIP file and downloaded to your computer upon request. All of these actions take place within your browser, ensuring data privacy.    

Whether you're a researcher looking to eliminate bias from your data analysis, a professional needing to anonymize sensitive files, or just looking for a simple tool to randomly rename files, ShuffledSight offers a straightforward solution. With ShuffledSight, you gain a fresh, unbiased perspective on your files.
